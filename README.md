## Overview
  The purpose of this project is to build a Model Predictive Controller, using the content built during the MPC quizes, and relying on a number of topics covered previously, such a coordinate rotation.  The project began with a code framework provided by the Udacity team, with specific sections left as TODO's for the student to complete.  The bulk of the code was taken from the MPC quiz code, which had been developed in the lesson just prevously.  In the project, this code was tied to the simulator used througout this term, cost function weights modified, and actuator latency accounted for.  The output of the project code are JSON messages which allow the simluator to drive the virtual car around the lake track, display the road's target trajectory(yellow), along with the MPC's planned trajectory(green).  The output of a successful run around the track can be seen in the video section of the writeup.

  The build instructions follow, with the Rubric at the end of this README.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Rubric

The Rubric is a set of goals the project code must meet.  I address each one here.  
1) The code must compile with "cmake" and "make.   
   The code does compile with cmake and make, and all warnings have been cleaned up.

2) The Model.  (Describe the model in detail)  
  The model contains 6 features stored in a vector, along with 2 actuators.  The state includes the x and y position, the angle psi, the cross track error, and the psi error[x,y,?,v,cte,e?].  The two actuator values are the delta(steering) and accelleration(throttle)[eÌˆ,a].
  The model attempts to predict a desired future state for the vehicle N time steps into the future, relying on a target trajectory and a cost function.  The model attempts to limit the result of this cost function, which includes a number of factors about the car's behavior.  The most important of these factors is the error between the car's position and the desired lane centerline, or "cross track error" or CTE.  If the CTE is too great, the car ends up in a ditch.  However, the CTE is not the only important part of the cost function.  The angle or heading of the vehicle, the speed, and the degree of change in steering are all important to ensure that the car stays on the road, and the passengers are not injured along the way.  In trying to reach the centerline and minimize the CTE, too great of a steering angle will result in swerving, and too great of a change in throttle will result in seat-belt bruises.  For these reasons, the CTE and psi error are weighted in the cost function as the largest influencers, with the steering and throttle also included, but with smaller weights.  This slows the rate of change of any aspect of the vehicle's behavior, while aiming for a centered and stable trip.  To avoid this cost function finding a local minimum and simply stopping in the middle of the road, we also penalize the vehicle for traveling at any speed below a target reference velocity, here set to 60.
  The vars vector is a vector including N * the 6 features and 2 actuators, holding the projected future states predicted by the model.  The fg vector contains the cost function at fg[0], plus the vars content and the constraints we will define on the model.
  Ipopt expects equations with an upper and lower bound for the acceptable solutions.  For most of our purposes, we are attempting to find 0 difference, denoting an equality.  So instead of calculating x1, we find the difference between the projected x1 and the calculation used to find it:  x1 - (x0 + v0 * CppAD::cos(psi0) * dt) .
  We then use the provided polyfit equation to fit a third order polynomial to the waypoints, and get back a vectors of coefficients, which are in turn used to find the cross track error and psi error.  This process is then repeated, using the letancy-controlled state to re-initialize the predicted trajectory, and re-determine the CTE and psi error once again.

3) Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)  
  N was originally set to 20, with a dt of 0.05, which is 1s/N.  This lead to a fairly chaotic result, with the car eventually running off the track.  I set about shortening the N value per the recomendation in the lessons of "as large as possible" (but not too large).  Moving to N=15 and dt of 0.06667, the results was improved but still not good enough.  I tried N=10 and dt=0.01 as suggested in the Q&A video, and that value pair worked.  I also tried values lower than 10 for N, with decresing effectiveness as the number got smaller - for example, an N of 6 resulted in a successful run of the track, but the car hung to the right shoulder the entire time. 

4) Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing  
   The polyfit() function provided in the framework code was used to fit a third order polynomial to the waypints of the target trajectory.  The only major preprocessing done was to rotate from the global to car coordinate space.

5) Model Predictive Control with Latency  
  The projejct induded a requirement to handle artificial latency added into the code by a sleep() line, pausing the system for 100 milliseconds.  This delay was added to model real-world delays between issuing a command to a actuator and the actuator completing that command, including all latency in communication channels between them.  To account for this delay, I have altered the model's state to include a 0.1s offset, in place of the 0's mentioned in the Q&A.  This was fed to the solver instead of the current state, effectively making decisions based on the car's future state rather than the current state.
  This also required using the full formula for calculating the epsi, in place of the truncated version discussed in the Q&A video.

6) The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.  
  With the current cost function weights, the car completes a lap of the track.  See https://youtu.be/6fz-J8Ld4Wg for a 2-lap recording of the MPC in practice.

## Conclusion
  The MPC project was a difficult one, mostly due to the translation between theory and implementation through the Ipopt and CppAD libraries.  These had not been introduced prior to the MPC quizes, and installing them proved difficult; it took about 6 hours to get them working mostly in the configuration I have been using for Term 2, partially because the coin-or servers were down.
  The other difficult aspect was applying the lesson's information on constraints to how Ipopt actually works.  While I understood the lesson's specific content, how to translate that into functional code was not clear to me at all by the time the MPC quiz apeared.  This was helped greatly by the Q&A video and the student forum discussions, of which there were many, suggesting a general confusion on this topic.  There is still a fair amount of the MPC process which seems unclear to me at this point, and I hope to get a better understanding during path planning in Part 3.
